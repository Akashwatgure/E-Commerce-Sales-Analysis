## üìä Project Overview

This analysis focuses on visualizing and interpreting the performance of an e-commerce business over multiple years. The Excel dashboard provides an initial breakdown of sales performance by category, segment, and region. The Power BI dashboard enhances this with dynamic filtering, time series analysis, and deep dives into profitability and customer segmentation.

Forecasting models are implemented to estimate future sales and profit, assisting decision-makers in planning for upcoming business cycles. The goal is to identify underperforming areas, improve shipment efficiency, and align marketing or discount strategies with actual customer and product data.

## üìå Key Insights & Business Findings

- Historical trends in sales and profit reveal seasonal fluctuations and a gradual decline in key metrics in recent years. Forecasting tools help estimate expected performance in the next fiscal period.
  
- Analysis highlights contributing factors to downward trends, including over-discounting, high shipping costs, and low-performing sub-categories.

- Shipment delays correlate with decreased customer satisfaction, especially for specific shipping modes. Recommendations are made for improving delivery timelines while managing cost.

- Customer segmentation shows varying average sales and profitability across Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office groups, helping prioritize high-value customers.

- Product categories are evaluated for discount viability. Specific segments show resilience to discounting while maintaining profit margins.

- Regional performance identifies high-order zones with the potential for focused campaigns or improved logistics.

- A year-over-year breakdown of profit, sales, orders, and margins provides a clear picture of business growth, operational efficiency, and potential risks.

- Data-backed strategies are proposed to enhance profit margins by realigning category focus, optimizing shipping options, and refining promotional strategies.
